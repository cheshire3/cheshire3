The Watergate scandal was a political scandal that occurred in the United
States in the 1970s as a result of the June 1972 break-in at the Democratic
National Committee headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington,
D.C., and the Nixon administration's attempted cover-up of its involvement.
